## What is Evidence Synthesis?

-   Evidence synthesis is the process of gathering, combining, and interpreting research from multiple studies to draw broader conclusions.

-   We are often tasked with making sense of diverse studies on similar topics. Evidence synthesis allows us to combine results and make decisions based on the bigger picture.

## Why cant we rely on single studies?

-   Single studies can be misleading or misinterpreted.
-   Single studies can be biased, poorly designed, or limited in scope.
-   They may not represent the full range of conditions.
-   They can be influenced by publication bias
-   They may not be replicable or generalisable to other contexts.
-   They may not be transparent in their methods or data

# Types of Evidence Synthesis

## Essential steps in evidence synthesis

![](images/clipboard-3014003817.png)

# [The Review family]{style="color:darkred;"}

## Narrative Review

-   A summary of studies, but typically lacks formal methods for study selection or quality assessment.

-   Good for broad overviews but less reliable in terms of conclusions.

-   Example: A narrative review of school feeding programs across low-income countries might describe various initiatives but not assess their quality or impact rigorously.

## Systematic Review

-   Uses strict, [predefined]{style="color\"darkred\""} methods to select studies and assess their quality.

-   Example: *"What is the impact of school feeding programs on child nutrition outcomes?"*

## Meta-Analysis

-   A subset of systematic reviews, but with a statistical approach to combine effect sizes from different studies.

-   Helps estimate the **average effect** of an intervention and whether it's statistically significant.

-   Example: A meta-analysis could calculate the **pooled effect of school meals on test scores** across multiple countries.

[You can have a systematic review without a meta-analysis but not a meta-analysis without a systematic review]{style="color:darkred;"}

## Rapid Review

-   A **streamlined** review using shortcuts (e.g., limiting search databases or skipping quality appraisal) to deliver timely evidence.

-   Ideal for informing **urgent policy** decisions, though potentially less thorough.

-   Example: A rapid review might assess existing evidence on school feeding interventions **during a food crisis or pandemic**.

[There is no accepted definition of a Rapid Review and we do not often know which components we should cut and the impacts of that]{style="color:darkred;"}

## Living Review

-   A **continuously updated** review that incorporates new studies as they become available.

-   Especially useful in **fast-moving areas** where policies and interventions evolve rapidly.

-   Example: A living review on the **impacts of inflation on school meal programs** could update evidence as new economic data or interventions emerge.

## Umbrella Review

-   A **review of systematic reviews**, offering a bird's-eye view of findings across multiple questions or interventions.

-   Helps compare strategies and understand broader trends.

-   Example: An umbrella review could examine multiple systematic reviews on **nutrition interventions in schools**, comparing the effectiveness of feeding, deworming, and education programs.

# [Mapping family]{style="color:darkred;"}

## Systematic Map

-   A mapping process that categorises existing research but does not quantitatively synthesise results.

<!-- -->

-   Identifies **knowledge clusters and gaps**.

-   Example: A systematic map might chart all research on **school feeding interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa**, categorised by outcome (e.g., attendance, nutrition, learning).

## Scoping Review

-   A broader review that identifies the extent of research in a particular field or topic, often used to inform future research agendas.

-   Example: A scoping review could explore the range of outcomes studied in school feeding programs globally-e.g., **health, gender equity, education**.

## Evidence Gap Map (EGM)

-   A **visual tool** to show where evidence exists and where it's lacking.

-   Often used to support **funding and policy** decisions.

-   Example: An EGM on **school feeding and food security** might show many studies on health outcomes but few on long-term economic impacts.

# Why Methodological Rigor Matters

## Different synthesis methods provide varying levels of confidence and transparency

## Different types of primary evidence

## Common pitfalls

-   Without proper methods to assess study quality and bias, we might miss crucial information that could change the overall interpretation of the evidence

-   Publication bias can skew results, as studies with positive findings are more likely to be published.

-   Small studies can lead to false positives, as they may not have enough power to detect true effects.
