## Data Extraction & Critical Appraisal

Once you've identified relevant studies, the next step is to:

1. Extract key information systematically
2. (Optionally) Appraise the quality or relevance of the evidence

---

## What is Data Extraction?

Structured process to collect data from included studies.

🔑 Aim: Ensure consistency, transparency, and accuracy

Typical categories for extraction:
- 📄 Bibliographic details (author, year, title)
- 🌍 Study context (country, income level, school type)
- 👧 Population (age, gender, schooling stage)
- 🍎 Intervention (type, duration, delivery mechanism)
- 🎯 Outcomes measured (nutrition, attendance, performance)
- 🧪 Study design (RCT, observational, case study)
- 📈 Results (if relevant for maps/meta-analysis)

---

## Extraction in Practice

🛠 Tools:
- Excel or Google Sheets
- EPPI-Reviewer, Covidence, SRDR+
- CADIMA (free tool for systematic maps)

✅ Build a **coding framework** based on your question & PICO
✅ Pilot the form with 2-3 studies first
✅ Define clear coding rules (e.g., controlled = RCT, matched design, or natural experiment?)

## Example Coding Framework for School Feeding

| Field | Example Values |
|-------|----------------|
| Country | Kenya, India, Brazil |
| Intervention Type | Hot meal, snack, take-home ration |
| Delivery | School-based, community-based |
| Age Group | Primary, Secondary |
| Outcome Domain | Nutrition, Attendance, Cognitive |
| Study Design | RCT, Quasi-experimental, Cross-sectional |
| Comparator | No feeding, different intervention |
| Notes | Contextual details, challenges, implementation notes |

---

## What is Critical Appraisal?

An optional (but valuable) process in maps:

- 🧭 Helps assess **study trustworthiness, relevance, and rigour**
- Especially useful when considering **subgroup analysis** or **evidence weighting**

**Systematic maps** often **describe** risk of bias, rather than exclude studies.

---

## Appraisal Tools and Approaches

| Tool/Approach | Suited For |
|---------------|------------|
| Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) | Mixed designs |
| ROBINS-I | Non-randomised studies |
| Cochrane RoB 2 | RCTs |
| GRADE or GRADE-CERQual | Certainty in review findings |
| Custom ecological or education-specific checklists | Maps and bespoke criteria |

📌 Consider:
- Study design quality
- Relevance to your context
- Risk of bias (confounding, selection bias, reporting bias)

---

## Critical Appraisal in School Feeding Maps?

You might ask:

- Was the **intervention clearly described**?
- Was there a **comparator group**?
- Were **outcomes measured with validated tools**?
- Is the **study generalisable** to other LMIC settings?

✔️ Include fields in your coding sheet to capture these!

---

## Your Turn

Discuss with a partner:

- What **study features** would you want to extract from school feeding literature?
- What **indicators of quality** would be most useful for decision-makers?

Optional: Start drafting a mini data extraction form in Google Sheets or Excel.
