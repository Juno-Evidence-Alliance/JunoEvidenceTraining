## Data Extraction & Critical Appraisal

Once you've identified relevant studies, the next step is to:

1.  Extract key information systematically
2.  (Optionally) Appraise the quality or relevance of the evidence

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is Data Extraction?

Structured process to collect data from included studies.

Aim: Ensure consistency, transparency, and accuracy

Typical categories for extraction:

\- Bibliographic details (author, year, title)

\- Study context (country, income level, school type)

\- Population (age, gender, schooling stage)

\- Intervention (type, duration, delivery mechanism)

\- Outcomes measured (nutrition, attendance, performance)

\- Study design (RCT, observational, case study)

\- Results (if relevant for maps/meta-analysis)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Extraction in Practice

Tools: - Excel or Google Sheets - EPPI-Reviewer, Covidence, SRDR+ - CADIMA (free tool for systematic maps)

Build a **coding framework** based on your question & PICO

Pilot the form with 2-3 studies first

Define clear coding rules (e.g., controlled = RCT, matched design, or natural experiment?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example Coding Framework for School Feeding

| Field             | Example Values                                       |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Country           | Kenya, India, Brazil                                 |
| Intervention Type | Hot meal, snack, take-home ration                    |
| Delivery          | School-based, community-based                        |
| Age Group         | Primary, Secondary                                   |
| Outcome Domain    | Nutrition, Attendance, Cognitive                     |
| Study Design      | RCT, Quasi-experimental, Cross-sectional             |
| Comparator        | No feeding, different intervention                   |
| Notes             | Contextual details, challenges, implementation notes |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is Critical Appraisal?

An optional (but valuable) process in maps:

-   Helps assess **study trustworthiness, relevance, and rigour**
-   Especially useful when considering **subgroup analysis** or **evidence weighting**

**Systematic maps/reviews** **describe** risk of bias, rather than exclude studies. (in environmental fields at least...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Appraisal Tools and Approaches

| Tool/Approach | Suited For |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) | Mixed designs |
| ROBINS-I | Non-randomised studies |
| Cochrane RoB 2 | RCTs |
| GRADE or GRADE-CERQual | Certainty in review findings |
| Custom ecological or education-specific checklists | Maps and bespoke criteria |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Critical Appraisal in School Feeding Maps?

You might ask:

-   Was the **intervention clearly described**?
-   Was there a **comparator group**?
-   Were **outcomes measured with validated tools**?
-   Is the **study generalisable** to other LMIC settings?

Include fields in your coding sheet to capture these!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Your Turn

-   What **study features** would you want to extract from school feeding literature?
-   What **indicators of quality** would be most useful for decision-makers?
