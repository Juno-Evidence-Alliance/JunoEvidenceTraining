## Synthesis Methods

Once data are extracted, we need to make sense of it all:

üéØ What patterns emerge?
üìä Can we combine results statistically?
üß≠ What gaps remain?

---

## Types of Synthesis

| Method | Used For | Common in |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Narrative synthesis** | Describing patterns, themes, study characteristics | Systematic maps & reviews |
| **Descriptive synthesis** | Tables, counts, frequencies | Systematic maps |
| **Meta-analysis** | Quantitative combination of results | Systematic reviews |
| **Thematic synthesis** | Qualitative patterns from text | Mixed-methods or qualitative reviews |

---

## Narrative Synthesis

Tells the **story** of the evidence:

- Summarises **who studied what, where, and how**
- Identifies **patterns, themes, contradictions**
- Often uses **structured tables** and thematic grouping

üõ† Useful when:
- Studies are too heterogeneous to meta-analyse
- Outcomes or interventions are diverse

---

## Narrative Synthesis Example

> ‚ÄúMost school feeding studies in Sub-Saharan Africa focused on nutrition and attendance, but fewer addressed cognitive outcomes. Hot meals were the most common intervention, often targeted to primary school children.‚Äù

Common presentation tools:
- Tables of intervention types by country
- Frequency counts (e.g., how many studies found a positive effect)
- Thematic summary by outcome domain

---

## Systematic Maps: Descriptive Synthesis

Typical outputs:
- üì¶ Evidence matrices
- üìç Geographic maps
- üìä Bar charts of intervention types
- üß≠ Research gap maps

Aim: Show **what exists**, not estimate effects.

Example question:
> ‚ÄúWhat evidence exists on the impact of school feeding on children‚Äôs education in LMICs?‚Äù

---

## Transition to Meta-Analysis

If studies:
- Measure **comparable outcomes**
- Use **similar designs**
- Report **effect sizes or data to calculate them**

Then we can **quantitatively combine results** using a **meta-analysis**.

üßÆ Meta-analysis:
- Calculates an **average effect**
- Tests for **variation (heterogeneity)**
- Examines **moderators** (e.g., age group, intervention type)

## Synthesis in Practice

| Review Type | Common Synthesis Approach |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| Systematic Map | Descriptive tables, frequencies, mapping |
| Systematic Review (qualitative) | Narrative synthesis |
| Systematic Review (quantitative) | Meta-analysis |
| Mixed-methods | Combination of the above |

## Your Turn

Look at your question and study set:

- What kind of synthesis is appropriate?
- What information do you need from your data extraction to support that?
- Would visual summaries help? (e.g., intervention-outcome matrix)
