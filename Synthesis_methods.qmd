## Synthesis Methods

Once data are extracted, we need to make sense of it all:

What patterns emerge?

Can we combine results statistically?

What gaps remain?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative Synthesis

**Awful name** \[Not a Narrative Review\]

Tells the **story** of the evidence:

-   Summarises **who studied what, where, and how**
-   Identifies **patterns, themes, contradictions**
-   Often uses **structured tables** and thematic grouping

Useful when: - Studies are too heterogeneous to meta-analyse - Outcomes or interventions are diverse

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative Synthesis Example

> “Most school feeding studies in Sub-Saharan Africa focused on nutrition and attendance, but fewer addressed cognitive outcomes. Hot meals were the most common intervention, often targeted to primary school children.”

Common presentation tools: - Tables of intervention types by country) - Thematic summary by outcome domain

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Systematic Maps: Descriptive Synthesis

Typical outputs:

-   Evidence matrices

-   Geographic maps

-   Bar charts of intervention types

-   Research gap maps

Aim: Show **what exists**, not estimate effects.

Example question: “What evidence exists on the impact of school feeding on children’s education in LMICs?”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Transition to Meta-Analysis

If studies: - Measure **comparable outcomes** - Use **similar designs** - Report **effect sizes or data to calculate them**

Then we can **quantitatively combine results** using a **meta-analysis**.

Meta-analysis: - Calculates an **average effect** - Tests for **variation (heterogeneity)** - Examines **moderators** (e.g., age group, intervention type)
