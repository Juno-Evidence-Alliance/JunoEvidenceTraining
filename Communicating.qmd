## 

A good evidence synthesis is only useful if it's understood and used.

Goal: Make your findings accessible, relevant, and actionable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Audiences and Uses

| Audience | Use of Evidence |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Policymakers | Inform policy design, scaling, or targeting of programs |
| NGOs / Practitioners | Improve delivery, design interventions |
| Researchers | Identify gaps, refine questions |
| Funders | Support investment decisions and prioritisation |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Policy Engagement Starts Early

Involve users from the start:

-   Identify **policy-relevant questions**
-   Involve stakeholders in defining outcomes
-   Engage them in interpreting results

Co-production builds **trust and relevance**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Decision Models & Frameworks

Evidence synthesis supports:

-   **Theory of change** refinement
-   **Cost-effectiveness comparisons**
-   **Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)**
-   **Logic models** for implementation

Can incorporate evidence from systematic maps (e.g., what interventions exist, where, and for whom?)

## From Evidence to Briefs

A good **policy brief**:

-   Summarises key findings in plain language
-   Links evidence to policy challenges
-   Is short, visually engaging, and timely
-   Includes caveats and recommendations

📝 2–4 pages max, with **clear, actionable messages**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Visualising Evidence

Help stakeholders understand the big picture with:

-   Evidence heat maps
-   Geographic distribution maps
-   Intervention-outcome matrices
-   Certainty summaries (traffic light systems)

Make your synthesis visually engaging and decision-friendly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: From Map to Action

> A systematic map on school feeding found 80 studies, but only 10 in low-income countries and only 3 measuring learning outcomes.

Next steps: - Commission impact evaluations in under-represented areas - Refocus programs to test broader outcomes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Common Pitfalls

🚫 Technical reports no one reads\
🚫 Over-claiming results from poor-quality studies\
🚫 Ignoring uncertainty and context

✔️ Instead: - Translate, don’t oversimplify - Tailor to your audience - Provide clear but nuanced messages

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Your Turn

Discuss:

-   Who are your **target users**?
-   What **decisions** could your synthesis inform?
-   How might you **present your findings** to support action?
